    "The simplest method of obtaining a lower-bound class is based on counting the number of items in the problem’s input that must be processed and the number of output items that need to be produced. Since any algorithm must at least “read” all the items it needs to process and “write” all its output, such a count yields a trivial lower bound, but there is an obstacle in deriving a meaningful lower bound by this method. It lies in determining which part of an input must be processed by any algorithm solving the problem in question. For example, searching for an element of a given value in a sorted array does not require processing all its elements. \n"
